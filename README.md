# Sugarcane-Project_using_EDA
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) case study developed as part of the GeeksforGeeks Data Analysis course. It focuses on analyzing a sugarcane-related dataset through various EDA techniques, including data cleaning, visualization, and pattern discovery.

Throughout the project, we explored the following:

Univariate Analysis – Understanding individual variables using visual tools like bar graphs, histograms, pie charts, and box plots.

Bivariate Analysis – Exploring relationships between two variables using scatter plots, line plots, and violin plots.

Correlation Matrix – Evaluating the strength and direction of relationships between multiple variables to identify significant patterns and dependencies.

This hands-on project helped reinforce foundational EDA concepts and techniques using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
